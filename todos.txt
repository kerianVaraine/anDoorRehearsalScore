TODO:
[ ] try deploy on heroku for always available...
    https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/node-websockets -- very basic deploy guide for websocket app./


[ ] collapse update dynamics functions into one call, with checks in that function...

[ ] what buttons need to be there and which do not? 

[ ] style the page elements
[ ] progress bar

[ ] Performance notes: 
    load a specific svg with instructions on it, button clickable on main page. 
        make as a modal style popup?



[ ] make more efficient, HA!

Must Haves:

    [ ] UX: Progress bar for entire piece


    [x] Synced across performers:
        Central control for initiating all actions, ie: "conductor" view.
    
    [x] Conductor Logic:
            set rehearsal mark, play, pause.
 

    [ ] Styling:
        [x] normalize.css
        [ ] Interaction Feedback, ie: change colours of buttons when playing, fast forwarding etc
        [ ] make things more UX friendly, button labeling, 
        [ ] Invert Colours


Score Finishing:
    [x] Dynamics: ADS svg icons that hover while scrolling, 
            indicating how the attack of note heads happens.
        Attack Decay Sustain x axis, y axis = loudness ie:pp->ff
        Release is shown through dynamics in score. used sparingly. 
            If no dynamics then abrupt end to note


Nice to haves:
