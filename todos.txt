Must Haves:

    [ ] UX: Progress bar for entire piece

    [ ] Performance notes: 
        load a specific svg with instructions on it, button clickable on main page. 
            make as a modal style popup?

    [ ] Synced across performers:
        Central control for initiating all actions, ie: "conductor" view.
        Ideally using soundWorks to learn more for future pieces.

    [ ] Styling:
        [X] normalize.css
        [ ] Interaction Feedback, ie: change colours of buttons when playing, fast forwarding etc
        [ ] make things more UX friendly, button labeling, 
        [ ] Invert Colours





Nice to haves:
